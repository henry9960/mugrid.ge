# My personal website.

# DONE IN VERION 2.1:
- Grid fixed on the right hand side fot the module widgets.

# MORE TO-DO FOR VERSION 2:
- Implement a dark mode that fades in from wherever the button is clicked. Need to figure out what kind of dark mode I'll be implementing and what colours to swap. Research needed.
- Add a typing animation for my name when the page first loads in!
- Add an embed image for when my site is linked anywhere!
- Add web redirects for github, linkedin, ig, twitter like:
    twitter.mugrid.ge
    ig.mugrid.ge
    linkedin.mugrid.ge
    github.mugrid.ge
- Media queries & make the site responsive.
- Fix the grid on the right side.
